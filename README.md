Drilling Localization and Error Analysis of Radial Horizontal Jet Drilling Based on Magnetic Gradient Tensor. (ID: energies-910205)
 - Position.m--The localization errors varying with the distance between source and MGT system, that is, the data in Figure 3.
 - Magnetic_strength.m--The localization errors varying with the distance between source and MGT system when the equivalent magnetic moment was changed to (50,9255,145)Aâˆ™m^2, that is, the data in Figure 4.
 - Precision.m--The localization errors varying with the distance between source and MGT system when the equivalent magnetic moment was changed to 0.1pT, that is, the data in Figure 5.
 - Baseline_distance_.m--The localization errors varying with the baseline distances when the coordinates of the measuring point is (x,y,z)=(5,0,-1), (10,0,-1), (15,0,-1), (20,0,-1)m, that is, the data in Figure 6.
